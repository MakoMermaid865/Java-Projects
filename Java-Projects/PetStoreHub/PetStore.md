 # MyPetHub
 (Inspired my Dr.Anderson) FullStack: build frontend and backend

 ##  Description
The purpose of the pet store app is to provide seamless shopping for pet owners. Users can browse and purchase pets, treats, toys, clothes, and essentials directly from their phones. The app also offers a service booking feature, allowing users to schedule grooming appointments, dog training sessions, and more with ease. In addition, it helps users find these services quickly and affordably. The app includes a community marketplace where you can discover local pet sitters and caregivers nearby, making pet care more accessible. With a tailored experience, the app provides personalized recommendations for pet products based on your pet's breed, size, and preferences. Whether you need a last-minute pet sitter or a new cozy bed for your furry friend, the app simplifies the process. The goal is to create a pet lover’s dream wrapped into one smart platform!

## What’s needed:
**Database Management:** Utilize PostgreSQL to store pet profiles, product listings, bookings, and user accounts.

**Front End:** Build the application using React.

**User Profiles:** Customers should have the ability to create accounts and track their purchases, appointments, and pet care history.

**Service Booking:** Implement a scheduling system for grooming, training, vet visits, and other pet-related services.

**Backend Development:** Develop APIs to manage transactions, scheduling, and user interactions.

**Security & Authentication:** Employ strong encryption measures to protect user data and transactions.

**Customer Support:** I am installing an AI chatbot to assist customers, replacing traditional customer service support.

## Project Guide
 ### Dependencies
**Google Maps API:** The app includes location-based services to help users find sitter locations and dog training options.

**Frontend:** The core framework for building the user interface (UI) is React, along with axios for handling other API requests.

**Backend:** The app uses the Firebase SDK for authentication, database management, and hosting, while Node.js serves as a lightweight framework for building the backend.

**Python:** This language is utilized to implement AI recommendations for pet products, including a chatbot feature.

**Swift & Kotlin:** These languages are used for developing an Android app.

 ### How to run the project
 - have 20 files (more manageable that way and just call in the main method)
 - many line of code/reviewed on test code through the terminal
 - run the game based on user input (monitored my AI reports)
 ### How to use the app
Create a profile page and go through security authentication by obtaining a code to confirm your email or address. 
At the bottom of the page, there will be a shopping bag icon where you can shop for essentials like toys, clothes, and pet supplies. 
Press the dog walking icon to find services for pet sitting, pet training, and grooming. 
The messaging chat icon allows you to connect with other pet owners. 
On your profile page, you can upload pictures and share your experiences as a pet owner.
 ## Lessons Learned
I learned to work on a full-stack application and more about building Android applications, as well as understanding how APIs work.
