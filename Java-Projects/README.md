# 🚀 Java Projects – Monthly Challenges  

Welcome to my Java Projects repository! My goal is to work on **monthly projects** and share my progress consistently. Throughout the year, I will tackle **ABC projects**, where each project is inspired by a letter of the alphabet.

Some projects will be standalone practice exercises, like my trivia game, while others will be part of the **ABC challenge**—you’ll know because they’ll be labeled accordingly. Thanks for checking out my work, and I hope you enjoy exploring these projects!
