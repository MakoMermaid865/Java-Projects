 # Project Title
 Hunger Games
 ## Project Description
 The game's purpose is to survive and overcome many challenges. The goal is to be the last player standing. Multiple players will participate, but one of the players will be an AI designed to sabotage the others and monitor them for cheating or manipulation.
 Technically players don't have to kill each other, the game will try to kill all of them!

Whatâ€™s needed:

- Game concepts
- Object-oriented programming (OOP) principles, which include:
  - Classes for characters, monsters, and the environment
  - Details for character encapsulation, including attributes such as health, logic, spirit, mental state, emotion, and theory
- Game loops
- Machine learning (ML) and AI algorithms to process events, player actions, behaviors, and the environment, as well as to generate reports on player activity
- Logic for random selection of games and player outcomes
- Data structures such as lists and arrays to manage characters
- File input/output (File-IO) for saving and loading game status
- 3D graphic design

## Project Guide
 ### Dependencies
 To run the code, Java and python(ai code) needs to be installed along with a coding platform like Visual Studio Code.
 ### How to run the project
-have 20 files (more manageable that way and just call in the main method)
 -many line of code/reviewed on
test code through the terminal
run the game based on user input (monitored my AI reports)
 ### How to play the game
 - Understand that players must survive, navigate the game, and adapt to their surroundings.
- Use the arrow keys and controls to move around. Change your viewpoint to see everything, similar to Minecraft.
- Communicate with other players by sending direct messages and voice messages.
- Players can customize their characters and choose voice settings, just like on the testing site.
- Avoid traps in the game and be cautious of other players who may come after you.
- Be careful about whom you trust and hang around; one of them may be an AI trying to play you.
- Features are added to help you survive in the game.
Based on certain reports, every player will receive a special feature specifically designed for that user.
- Take breaks if needed; the game will automatically log out if it has been active for more than three hours for safety reasons.
 
 ## Lessons Learned
I learned more about AI and machine learning algorithms because I wanted to incorporate AI into the game. The challenging part was programming it to have a personality. Additionally, I struggled with some bugs related to the files, as I generally find that difficult.
